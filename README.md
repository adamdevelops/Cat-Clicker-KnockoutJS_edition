# Cat Clicker KnockoutJS edition


## Description:

A web application that counts the number clicks on the picture of a cat but this time done in a organizational framework called KnockoutJS. The app is being built through KnockoutJS to learn the concept of using frameworks to simplify creating MVC-like code structure or in the case of KnockoutJS, the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) structure. This app builds upon the previous concepts learned in the previous versions of Cat Clicker.

This app was made as an assignment from Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree.
